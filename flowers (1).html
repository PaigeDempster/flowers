<h2><section class="second-title"><a id="About_4"></a>About</h2></section>

<p><section class="text">I just really like flowers. They’re pretty and smell nice and taking care of them is so rewarding because you see the magic of nature by literally just watering them and keeping them by a window. If I couldn’t be an artist I’d go as far to say that I’d be a florist instead, even though I don’t know much about the profession. And because I don’t know much about being a florist, I’m going to do research about some of my favorite flowers and put my findings here.</p></section>

<section class="more-text"><p>Good God. I. Love. Phlox. So much. I’ve loved them since I was a kid when my dad planted a bunch in our garden. Sadly those flowers have died since then, and I’ve tried growing my own but could never get them to be as beautiful as my dad did; they sprout kind of splotchy and half dead looking until the deer come and put the plants out of their misery by eating the few flowers that bloomed.</p>

<p>Well the first thing I learned is that phlox is spelt p-h-l-o-x and not f-l-o-c-k-s, I feel like I’ve been lied to my whole life. Anyway there are two main varieties of phlox: creeping and goliath, I prefer the creeping variety. They bloom in the spring and summer and require either full or partial sun exposure. Phlox are supposed to be extremely easy to take care of, but can be susceptible to many different mites and parasites which may have killed the ones I tried to grow.</p></section>

<section class="images"><img src="https://github.com/PaigeDempster/flowers/blob/master/hydrangeas.png?raw=true" alt="hydrangeas"></section>

<section class="more-text"><p>These are ones I’ve discovered more recently but have come to like. I found out about them by playing Animal Crossing on my 3ds. The character that sells gardening supplies in the game eventually will sell you bush starters, and one of the types of starters sprout hydrangea flowers in the spring and summer. I’ve adored them since then, but I’ve never tried to grow them myself.</p>

<p>Animal Crossing has also lied to me, as hydrangeas don’t bloom in the spring and summer, but the summer and fall. As far as raising them goes, they’re a little harder to maintain than phlox. First of all they require either a Ph neutral or slightly acidic soil to grow correctly, you can actually control the color of the flower by changing the Ph of the soil! A Ph less than 5.5 creates a blue flower, while greater than 5.5 creates a pink one. Next, they specifically should take in sunshine before the afternoon, then be partially shaded for the rest of the day. Other than that though, the only pests they can contract are slugs, which can easily be prevented by getting your lawn treated for them once or twice a year.</p></section></section>

<section class="images">

<section class="more-text"><p>They’re like rose’s ugly cousin but I’ve always liked them better, maybe because they’re always outshined by roses and I want to route for the underdog. I have successfully grown tulips before and know how to take care of them, the only problem is the deer that live around my house love to eat them, so the tulips don’t live for long once I transfer them from pot to garden.</p>

<p>I didn’t learn much that I didn’t know in my research, only that tulip bulbs (seeds) should be stored in a very dry well ventilated area and that the soil shouldn’t be wet when you plant them. When I researched how to protect against pests however, I found that a great way to prevent deer from eating any flowers is by sprinkling powdered pig’s blood around the flowers once a week. The deer are apparently appalled by the smell and won’t go near out of fear that a predator will be nearby because of the blood. Powdered pig’s blood can be found in most hunting stores so thankfully I won’t have to kill a pig to get it.</p></section></section>
